--------------------------
✅ Best for running background tasks individually
Starts coroutines immediately.
Each task runs independently.
Must await each task separately for results.
Used when some tasks might not need awaiting.

🔹 asyncio.gather():
---------------------
✅ Best for collecting multiple task results together
Starts all tasks at the same time.
Waits for all tasks to finish together.
Returns results in a list.
Shorter & more efficient than asyncio.create_task() for grouped tasks.
